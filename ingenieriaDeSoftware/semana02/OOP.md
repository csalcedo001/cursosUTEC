#nombre Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Three characteristics of an object

* Data and operations
* Interface and implementation
* Send messagges between each other

## Two parts

* Data: Static and immutable
* Operations: Chage data

_Every Object has state and data._

## Java Objects

* Don't have a destructor. Java has a garbage collector.
