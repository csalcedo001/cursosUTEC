# Project Planning

One of most important jobs of a software project manager.

## Decompose Project

Divide project in tasks and, if necessary, those tasks into subtasks.

Set dependencies between tasks and estimate the effort needed to complete that task in 1 man day of work.

**Must** have well defined tasks

__Note__: Define iteration.

# Milestones

Tasks that must be accomplished to continue with the project. It has a deadline.

# Buffer

Additional time to absorb unforseen delays.

## Issue Trackers

__Example__: Jira

## GANTT Chart

Bar diagram that tracks tasks.

## PERT chart
